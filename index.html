      <p>
Hi, I’m Tomas Kuruc. I have a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science and experience in data analysis, software development, and hardware projects, including an internship at RevolutionG Gaming. I’m a problem solver with a creative mindset and strong communication skills, and I enjoy working with teams to turn ideas into innovative solutions. Please explore my portfolio and feel free to get in touch if anything catches your interest — I’m actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and make an impact.

      <h2>University</h2>
      <p>
I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in November 2025, where I developed a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical computing. I achieved high grades in key modules such as Web Design, Advanced Data Structures, and Numerical Analysis, which strengthened my skills in algorithmic thinking, software development, and problem-solving.
<br><br>
Throughout university, I actively contributed to the student community as a member of the esports committee, as well as the volleyball and badminton societies, balancing teamwork and leadership alongside my studies. I collaborated on a variety of student projects, including designing a better Linux taskbar and building an ortholinear mechanical keyboard from the ground up. Additionally, I contributed to the coding efforts for <a href="https://www.strathais.com/strathcube25" target="_blank">STRATHcube</a>, a satellite project led by the University of Strathclyde, gaining experience in real-world, mission-critical software development.

      <h2>Internship</h2>
      <p>
        During my internship at RevolutionG Gaming, I contributed to data analysis and market research for gaming and esports events on the West Coast of the United States. I worked extensively with Google Looker Studio and BigQuery, sharpening my SQL skills to a professional level, and leveraged Excel and Power BI for data visualisation and reporting. The role also strengthened my communication and collaboration skills, as I coordinated with teams to organise successful gaming events while translating complex data insights into actionable recommendations.
      </p>


      <p>
        Gained professional proficiency in SQL, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Window functions and ranking</li>
        <li>Common Table Expressions</li>
        <li>Subqueries and correlated subqueries</li>
        <li>Joins and advanced aggregations</li>
        <li>Optimising query performance</li>

One of my key projects has been developing custom firmware for a gaming mouse I designed and built from the ground up. The first version ran on an RP2040 using CircuitPython, where I implemented USB HID input handling and SPI communication with PixArt optical sensors, before later porting the firmware to Arduino C++ for greater control and performance. I’m currently working on a second-generation version based on Nordic microcontrollers, focusing on lower latency, more efficient SPI handling, and overall higher performance.

            I built an ASCII art converter in Python that analyses image pixel brightness and maps it to character density to recreate images using text. This project strengthened my understanding of image processing, algorithmic thinking, and efficient data handling, while reinforcing clean code structure and debugging practices.

            I'm grouping all my websites that I've designed over the years here. My most recent website I've built is the one you are currently on, hosting this static webpage on github pages. My first websites were a series of drawing webite using javascript canvas, with features like undos and downloads. I've designed custom store fronts for shopify stores like yaji.online (a keyboard parts retailer) and im working on a valorant lineups website called cypher.cam. I've also built a simple chatroom open only for 1 hour a day.
